# Virtual Painter - A Gesture-Controlled Whiteboard

This project is a virtual whiteboard application that allows you to draw, write, and interact with a digital canvas using hand gestures captured via a webcam. It leverages computer vision and machine learning technologies like OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition.

This application was built over the project example from [Murtaza's Workshop - Robotics and AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiwZaAVbXQo), extending its functionality with additional features and optimizations.
