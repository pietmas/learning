# Learning Journey Repository

In this repository, I am putting everything I am trying to learn, with small projects that help me exercise the usage of certain libraries and techniques. Currently, this repository includes a whiteboard project using OpenCV.

## Project List

- **Whiteboard Project**: A digital whiteboard created with OpenCV, allowing for basic drawing and interaction features. This project is based on the tutorial by Murtaza's Workshop, which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiwZaAVbXQo).

## Goals

1. Track my progress in learning new tools and libraries.
2. Apply theoretical knowledge in practical projects.
3. Develop a portfolio of projects showcasing my skills and interests.

Feel free to check back for updates as I continue adding new learning projects!
